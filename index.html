                I don't know what portfolios usually contain, so hi!!!! I'm
                a human... I guess? <span id="pronouns">(she/they)</span>
                I go by lots of names (no I'm not the youtuber lol. I do play
                gregtech though) and my personality seems to be dependent on
                whichever fictional person's characteristics my brain has
                decided to "borrow". Right now I'm feeling
                <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Marisa_Kirisame">witchy</a>
                'cause someone sent me a touhou metal album. I guess you could
                call that "meta".<br />
                I have way more projects than the ones listed here, though
                most of them in a state of perpetual incompleteness, but I'd
                rather keep my personal github and other accounts separate
                from this portfolio. That might change in the future.<br />
                I typically use Linux for everything, but this portfolio was
                made on windows. gross :\

                ^ this divider is literally the only interesting thing here.
                it do be scrolling -_-

                &lt;-- my account has everything I want to showcase here for now <br />
				I learned SCSS in one day and wrote that stats card thing while learning.<br />
				I also wrote a rendering library (ala react) for the todo project.<br />
				The countries project is entirely written in react, using babel to transform
				jsx into vanilla js. It was my first react project.<br /><br />
                I have no public social media at all for any of my online presences
                (unless you think github is social media).
                I like living in my metaphorical private cabin in the forest.

                    This is the blandest portfolio I've ever seen. Oh well,
                    at least it's pretty minimalist. It's certainly better
                    than one based on an overengineered template.<br />
                    Imagine presenting this pitiful amount of content
                    in a pretentious style like that:
                    *text wooshes in with an easing animation onto a white
                    material design card under a backdrop of stock mountains*
                    "it's your friendly neighborhood witch! [github link] byee"<br />
                    also these gifs wouldn't fit into that kind of theme:
